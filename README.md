ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a real-time language translation system using Neural Machine Translation (NMT). It leverages deep learning models, particularly sequence-to-sequence architectures with attention mechanisms, to provide accurate and context-aware translations between multiple languages.

ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Real-time translation between supported languages
âœ… Pre-trained transformer-based models for high accuracy
âœ… Custom dataset training for domain-specific translations
âœ… Support for multiple languages with dynamic model selection
âœ… Web-based or CLI interface for easy usage
âœ… Integration with APIs for speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionality

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Deep Learning (TensorFlow / PyTorch)
Transformers (e.g., BERT, T5, or OpenNMT models)
